# One More Cup of Coffee

**原唱**：Bob Dylan  
**作词**：Bob Dylan  
**作曲**：Bob Dylan  

Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky  
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie  
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love  
Your loyalty is not to me but to the stars above  

One more cup of coffee for the road  
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go  
To the valley below  

Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade  
He'll teach you how to pick and choose, and how to throw the blade  
He oversees his kingdom, so no stranger does intrude  
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food  

One more cup of coffee for the road  
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go  
To the valley below  

Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself  
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf  
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadow lark  
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark  

One more cup of coffee for the road  
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go  
To the valley below
